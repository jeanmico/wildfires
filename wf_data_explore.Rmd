## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library('lubridate')
library('tidyverse')
```

```{r}
raw_data = read.csv('/Volumes/Padlock/wildfires/birth_file_bayarea2021-02-01.csv')

births <- raw_data
# filter out any births here:
# restrict to singletons
births <- births %>% filter(PLURALITY_16 == 1)
```

Our sample size is `r nrow(base_addresses)`. Counties included: Alameda, 

# Exploratory figures

Remove or correct NA values
```{r}
births = births %>% filter(!is.na(gest_weeks))
```

```{r rename vars}
decodes = read.csv('~/wildfires/data_dict.csv')

dropcols <- decodes %>% filter(varname == '') %>% dplyr::select(rawname) # drop unneeded columns
births_tmp <- births %>% dplyr::select(-(dropcols$rawname))

keepcols <- decodes%>% filter(varname != '')
# create a named vector to use with dplyr::rename
name_vec <- keepcols$rawname
names(name_vec) <- keepcols$varname

births_tmp <- births_tmp %>% dplyr::rename(name_vec[name_vec %in% names(births_tmp)])

births_tmp <- births_tmp %>% mutate(male = case_when(female == 0 ~1, TRUE~0))

births <- births_tmp
```

Condense multiple binary columns into factors:
```{r}

factor_defs = read.csv('~/wildfires/factor_defs.csv')
factor_comps = read.csv('~/wildfires/factor_components.csv')

fact_cols = factor_defs$factname

births_tmp <- births

for (myfact in fact_cols) {
  fact_default <- filter(factor_defs, factname == myfact)$default
  print(myfact)
  
  births_tmp[myfact] = fact_default
  
  components <- filter(factor_comps, factname == myfact)$varname
  
  for (colname in components)({
    coldata=births_tmp[,colname]
    births_tmp[[myfact]][which(coldata==1)]=colname
    })
  
  mylevels <- c(fact_default, components)
  mylevels = mylevels[!duplicated(mylevels)]
  
  # convert the column to a factor and set the default
  births_tmp[[myfact]] <- factor(births_tmp[[myfact]], levels = mylevels)
}

births <- births_tmp
```

Make an intro table to make sure our results are correct
```{r check work}
library(tableone)
mytab <- CreateTableOne(vars = c(fact_cols, 'wic'), data = births, factorVars = fact_cols)

mytab
```




Apply a filter by gestational week: gestational weeks must be known, and <=41; add preterm birth flag
```{r}

births = births %>% filter(gest_weeks < 42)
births <- births %>% mutate(preterm = case_when(
  gest_weeks < 37 ~ 1,
  TRUE ~ 0))
```

Determine the start of the pregnancy (baby birth date - gestational weeks)
```{r}
births <- births %>% mutate(baby_DOB = mdy(baby_DOB)) %>%
  mutate(start_date = ymd(baby_DOB) - weeks(gest_weeks))
```

Define the fire period
```{r}
# this definition of the fire interval may change as the project continues
fire_start = '2018-11-08'
fire_length = make_difftime(days = 14) 

fire_intvl = as.interval(fire_length, ymd(fire_start))

births <- births %>% mutate(preg_intvl = as.interval(make_difftime(weeks = gest_weeks), start_date))

births <- births %>% mutate(preg_fire_ovrlp = int_overlaps(preg_intvl, fire_intvl))

table(births$preg_fire_ovrlp)
```

Determine the length of exposure in each trimester and which trimester has the greatest length of exposure.
```{r}

triweeks = 12
tridays = triweeks*7


births <- births %>% mutate(tri1 = as.interval(make_difftime(days = tridays), start_date),
                            tri2 = case_when(int_end(tri1) + days(tridays) < baby_DOB ~
                                               as.interval(make_difftime(days = tridays), int_end(tri1)),
                                             TRUE ~ interval(int_end(tri1), baby_DOB)),
                            tri3 = interval(int_end(tri2), baby_DOB)
                            )


# determine each trimester's overlap with the fire
births <- births %>% mutate(overlap1 = case_when(int_overlaps(tri1, fire_intvl) ~ 
                                                   as.duration(intersect(tri1, fire_intvl)),
                                                 TRUE ~ 0),
                            overlap2 = case_when(int_overlaps(tri2, fire_intvl) ~ 
                                                   as.duration(intersect(tri2, fire_intvl)),
                                                 TRUE ~ 0),
                            overlap3 = case_when(int_overlaps(tri3, fire_intvl) ~ 
                                                   as.duration(intersect(tri3, fire_intvl)),
                                                 TRUE ~ 0) )

# determine which trimester has the greatest overlap with the fire
cols = c('overlap1', 'overlap2', 'overlap3')
births <- births %>% mutate(exposure_tri = case_when(
  overlap1 == 0 & overlap2 == 0 & overlap3 == 0 ~ '',
  TRUE ~ cols[max.col(births %>% dplyr::select(all_of(cols)))]
      ))

# add the total overlap in days
births <- births %>% mutate(total_overlap_days = case_when(
  preg_fire_ovrlp ~ as.duration(intersect(fire_intvl, preg_intvl))/60/60/24,  # convert seconds into days
  TRUE ~ 0))

# add a binary exposure variable
births <- births %>% mutate(binary_exposed = case_when(
  exposure_tri == '' ~ FALSE,
  TRUE ~ TRUE
  ))
```


```{r}

overlap_days_hist <- ggplot(births, aes(x=total_overlap_days)) + 
  geom_histogram()  + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_y_log10()

overlap_days_hist
```

We need to avoid a fixed cohort bias. We do this by choosing a conception date cutoff such that we see the delivery of infants of all gestational ages. In other words, 42 weeks prior to 2019-12-31. Additionally, we consider that pregnancies conceived after the fire to be "exposed." Finally, we must also eliminate any pregnancies that were already at term by the time the smoke event started.
```{r}
cutoff_date = ymd('2019-12-31') - make_difftime(weeks = 42)

births <- births %>% filter(start_date < cutoff_date)
```


Make a timeline plot
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
births_dateplt <- births %>% arrange(desc(start_date)) %>% mutate(date_order = row_number())

births_dateplt <- births_dateplt %>% mutate(exposure_decode = 
                                              case_when(exposure_tri == 'overlap1' ~ "Trimester 1",
                                                        exposure_tri == 'overlap2' ~ "Trimester 2",
                                                        exposure_tri == 'overlap3' ~ "Trimester 3",
                                                        TRUE ~ "None"))
  

timeplt <- ggplot(births_dateplt, aes(as.Date(start_date), date_order, color=exposure_decode)) +
  geom_crossbar(aes(xmin = as.Date(start_date), xmax = as.Date(baby_DOB)), width = 0.2) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("grey", '#003366', '#2c6d62', '#9d78ba', '#daa425', '#923a49')) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=as.Date(int_start(fire_intvl)), xmax=as.Date(int_end(fire_intvl)), ymin=0, ymax=nrow(births_dateplt)),
              color="orange", alpha=0.007, fill='orange') +
  scale_x_date() + 
  xlab('Date') + 
  ylab('Pregnancy') +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype=c(1,1,1,1), size = 2.2))) + # can't seem to override legend symbol
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
        plot.background=element_blank(), 
        panel.background=element_rect(fill='white'), 
        panel.grid = element_line(color='grey', size=.1)) +
  #theme_minimal() +
  labs(color="Exposure timing")
  

timeplt
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

More time filtering: we consider that pregnancies conceived after the fire to be "exposed." Finally, we must also eliminate any pregnancies that were already at term by the time the smoke event started.

```{r time filtering}
# remove births conceived after the smoke period
fire_end = int_end(fire_intvl)

births_tmp <- births %>% mutate(keep_date = case_when(
  start_date >= fire_end ~ FALSE,
  TRUE ~ TRUE))

births_tmp <- births_tmp %>% filter(keep_date == TRUE)

# pregnancies which were exposed AFTER they had reached 37 weeks
term_length =  make_difftime(weeks = 37)

births_tmp <- births_tmp %>% mutate(keep_date = case_when(
  ymd(fire_start) - term_length >= start_date & binary_exposed == TRUE ~ FALSE,
  TRUE ~ TRUE
  ))

births_tmp <- births_tmp %>% filter(keep_date == TRUE)
births <- births_tmp

```


```{r}
ggsave(timeplt, file = '/Volumes/Padlock/wildfires/timeplot.png')
```

Plot: pregnancy duration by conception date
```{r pregnancy duration by conception}

preg_duration <- ggplot(births, aes(x = as.Date(start_date), y = gest_weeks, color=binary_exposed)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_date()


preg_duration

ggsave(preg_duration, file='~/wildfires/images/duration_by_start_date.png')
```

Histograms comparing exposed to unexposed 

```{r hist binary exposure}

gest_hist <- ggplot(births, aes(x=gest_weeks) ) +
  geom_histogram(bins = max(births$gest_weeks) - min(births$gest_weeks)) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_log10()
gest_hist

```

Histogram comparison

```{r histogram comparison}
compare_plt = births %>% mutate(unexp_weeks = case_when(binary_exposed == 0 ~gest_weeks)) %>%
  mutate(exp_weeks = case_when(binary_exposed == 1 ~gest_weeks))

nbins_exp = max(compare_plt$exp_weeks, na.rm=TRUE) - min(compare_plt$exp_weeks, na.rm=TRUE)
nbins_unexp = max(compare_plt$unexp_weeks, na.rm=TRUE) - min(compare_plt$unexp_weeks, na.rm=TRUE)

compare_hist <-ggplot(compare_plt, aes(x=x) ) +
  geom_histogram( aes(x = unexp_weeks), fill="#69b3a2", bins=nbins_unexp, alpha = .8 ) +
  geom_histogram( aes(x = exp_weeks), fill= "#404080", bins=nbins_exp, alpha = .8) +
  xlab("Pregnancy duration in gestational weeks") +
  theme_bw()

compare_hist

```

2D histogram??
```{r 2d hist}
twod_hist <- ggplot(births, aes(x=start_date, y=gest_weeks)) +
  geom_bin2d()

twod_hist

```



Simple table
```{r}
library(epitools)
tst <- epitable(births$binary_exposed, births$preterm)

epitab(tst)

```

Slightly less simple table
```{r trimester table}

tst_tri <- epitable(births$exposure_tri, births$preterm)

epitab(tst_tri)

```


Test a very simple logistic regression model: outcome is preterm birth (binary), input is covariates and duration trimester exposure.

```{r}
simple_lgt <- glm(preterm ~ race + ipi + edu + insurance + pn_care + bmi + wic + overlap1 + overlap2 + overlap3, data = births)

summary(simple_lgt)

```



Rolling mean?
```{r rolling mean}

library(zoo)

rollmean <- ggplot(births, aes(x=start_date, y=gest_weeks)) +
  #geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y=rollmean(gest_weeks, 30, na.pad=TRUE))) #+
  #geom_vline(aes(xintercept=as.Date(fire_start)))

rollmean
  
ggsave(rollmean, file='~/wildfires/rollmean_30.png')

```

Very simple time series 
```{r simple timeseries}

library(its.analysis)

my_its <- itsa.model(data = births,
                     time = start_date,
                     depvar = births$gest_weeks,
                     interrupt_var = births$binary_exposure)

```

```{r logistic lasso}
library(glmnet)



```
